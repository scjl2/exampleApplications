SCJ Level 2 Example Applications
--------------------------------
--------------------------------

Example programs written in SCJ Level 2, complient with the [HVM implementation of SCJ](http://www.icelab.dk/index.html).

Note: these programs also comply with the input pattern required by [TightRope](https://github.com/scjl2/circusTranslation.git), our prototype tool for translating SCJ Level 2 programs to *Circus*. Specifically, this means that all method names must be unique in the program, unless they are inherited methods. Further, no overloading is allowed.
